excerpt: 'Causal inference has an important role in different areas including machine learning, providing new modelings that can answer new prediction tasks. In order to do causal inference, we need to discover causal relationships between variables. There are different approaches for causal discovery from observational data including score-based methods. The primary objective of this systematic review is to identify different score-based methods that formulate the problem as a continuous optimization one. The results show that there are different challenges in causal discovery with continuous optimization including modifications applied to the objective function of causal discovery, the causality constraint of the optimization problem, and the optimization algorithm.
Also, we reformulate the problem of causal discovery as a graph matching problem which is a concave quadratic program, introducing a new direction for researching on causal discovery by continuous optimization.'

In recent years, neural networks have proven to be valuable tools in improving Model Predictive Control (MPC) for complex systems. This study takes a close look at how neural networks can be used to model the dynamics of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR), which is a common system in chemical processes. we explore how neural networks can serve as alternatives to traditional models in MPC, opening up new possibilities for combining advanced learning techniques with control systems. In this research we compare **MLPs** and **KANs** as a output layers architectures and using LSTM and GRU to handle time-serie data from dynamic of system.


**Pleased to announce that my latest project, conducted in collaboration with [S. Vahid Naghvi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bT9h5IAAAAJ&hl=en), is nearing its release. This study explores the application of neural network-based model predictive control (MPC) for a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR).
