## Education
* **M.S. in Artificial Intelligence**, University of Tehran, 2020 - 2022

* **B.S. in Computer Software Engineering**, Amirkabir University of Technology - Tehran Polytechnic, 2015 - 2020

## Research Experience

* **Research Assistant** at [Computational Audio-Vision Lab](https://visionlab.ut.ac.ir), June 2021 - Present

  * Researching on causal discovery algorithms using continuous optimization methods
under supervision of Dr. Reshad Hosseini and Dr. Mostafa Tavassolipour; Trying to
introduce a new optimization method.


* **Bachelor Thesis: Person-Recognition**, Spring 2020

  * Designed and implemented Person Recognition System as Person Attendance Tracker
using face recognition methods to track and record person’s identities in the videos
captured from security cameras. Achieved more than 90% tracking and recognition
accuracy in non-occluded and more than 80% in occluded areas. [(Link)](https://github.com/aliizadi/Person-Recognition)
