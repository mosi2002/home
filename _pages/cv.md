## Education

* **B.S. in Electrical Engineering**, Amirkabir University of Technology - Tehran Polytechnic, 2020 - present
  
* **High School Diploma**, National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (Sampad), 2014 - 2020
  

## Research Experience

* **Bachelor Thesis: Nueral network based state estimation using Lie derivative**,  2024

    * This Thesis consider the problem of state observation for nonlinear dynamics. The problem with model-based observer is due to the need of solving PDEs, in this thesis by using on-line learning and considering the observer dynamics as a Chen-Fliess series. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a chaotic dynamic. [(Link)](https://github.com/mosi2002/Bachelor_Thesis)
  

* **Research Assistant** at [Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI)](https://www.ripi.ir/), Mar 2024 - Present

  * Researching on Neural Network based Model Predictive Control (MPC) to explore how AI can enhance traditional control systems.

* **Research Assistant** at [school of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.aut.ac.ir/en), Dec 2023 - Present

  * Researching on various state estimation methods to evaluate their potential benefits in diverse applications. My focus is on comparing their strengths and weaknesses to see which works best in various situations. In particular, I am looking for Geometric methods for state estimation purpose.
