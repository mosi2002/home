* **B.S. in Electrical Engineering**, Amirkabir University of Technology - Tehran Polytechnic, 2020 - 2025
  
* **High School Diploma**, National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (Sampad), 2014 - 2020
  

## Research Experience


* **Research Assistant at school of Mathematical sciences in Tarbiat Modares University**, Jan 2025 - present
  *  Researching on jump-diffusion models 

*  **Research Assistant at Robotic and Artificial Intelligence Center lab in Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology**, Aug 2024 - Present
   * Researching on performance of loss functions for H&E image analysis under supervision of Dr. [Azadeh Fakhrzadeh](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=rnQMWNwAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Amir Hossein Seddighi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9RfEhtAAAAAJ&hl=en)

    
* **Bachelor Thesis: Nueral network based state estimation for non-linear systems**, 2024

  * This Thesis consider the problem of state observation for **nonlinear dynamics**. The problem with model-based observer is due to the need of solving PDEs, in this thesis by using on-line learning and considering the observer dynamics as a Chen-Fliess series. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a Oscillating system. [(Link)](https://github.com/mosi2002/Bachelor_Thesis)
