## Education

* **B.S. in Electrical Engineering**, Amirkabir University of Technology - Tehran Polytechnic, 2020 - present
  
* **High School Diploma**, National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (Sampad), 2014 - 2020
  

## Research Experience


*  **Research Assistant at artificial intelligence and data analysis (AIDA) lab in Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology**, Aug 2024 - Present
   * Researching on Multi-tasking learning for tissue analysis under supervision of Dr. [Azadeh Fakhrzadeh](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=rnQMWNwAAAAJ&hl=en).

    

* **Bachelor Thesis: Nueral network based state estimation using Lie derivative**,  2024

    * This Thesis consider the problem of state observation for nonlinear dynamics. The problem with model-based observer is due to the need of solving PDEs, in this thesis by using on-line learning and considering the observer dynamics as a Chen-Fliess series. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a Oscillating system. [(Link)](https://github.com/mosi2002/Bachelor_Thesis)
  

* **Research Assistant** at Digital Transformation Center in [Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI)](https://www.ripi.ir/), Mar 2024 - Present

  * Researching on Neural Network architectures for Object detection and Face Recognition under supervision of Dr. [Saeid Shokri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xKkMMu4AAAAJ&hl=en).

* **Research Assistant** at [school of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.aut.ac.ir/en), Dec 2023 - Present

  * Researching on various state estimation methods under supervision of Dr. [Farzaneh Abdollahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nmZp2s8AAAAJ&hl=en) to evaluate their potential benefits in diverse applications. My focus is on comparing their strengths and weaknesses to see which works best in various situations. In particular, I am looking for Geometric methods for state estimation purpose.
